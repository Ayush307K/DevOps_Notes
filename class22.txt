class 22 - Intorduction to Infrastructure provisioning and Terraform

Terraform & Infrastructure as Code – Revision Notes
Introduction to Terraform

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool

Used to provision and manage cloud infrastructure using code

Supports multiple cloud providers:

AWS

Azure

Google Cloud

Key Characteristics of Terraform

Platform Agnostic

Works across multiple cloud providers

Same configuration style regardless of provider

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure is defined using configuration files

Reduces manual errors

Ensures repeatability and consistency

Terraform Lifecycle Commands

Terraform follows a fixed workflow using core commands.

1. Terraform Init

Initializes the working directory

Downloads required:

Providers

Modules

Locks provider versions for compatibility

First command executed in any Terraform project

2. Terraform Plan

Compares:

Current infrastructure state

Desired state defined in .tf files

Generates an execution plan

Does not make real changes

Used to preview changes safely

3. Terraform Apply

Executes the plan

Creates or updates infrastructure

Brings actual resources to the desired state

Requires confirmation before execution

4. Terraform Destroy

Deletes all infrastructure created using Terraform

Cleans up resources completely

Used to avoid unnecessary cloud costs

Advantages of Using Terraform

Speed

Automates infrastructure provisioning

Saves time compared to manual setup

Consistency

Same configuration produces same infrastructure

Avoids environment drift

Version Control

.tf files can be stored in Git

Enables:

Rollback

Change tracking

Auditing

Supporting Tools & Related Concepts
Configuration Management Tools

Used alongside Terraform

Manage software and OS-level configurations

Examples:

Ansible

Puppet

Chef

Server Templating Tools

Help create environments or containers

Used with Terraform-managed infrastructure

Examples:

Vagrant (VM-based)

Docker (container-based)

Practical Demonstration (Class Example)
EC2 Instance Creation using Terraform

Define infrastructure in .tf files

Specify:

EC2 instance

Instance type

Region

Use commands:

terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply

Terraform state file tracks:

Created resources

Changes

Deletions

Terraform State Management

State file keeps record of infrastructure

Helps Terraform understand:

What exists

What needs change

Critical for collaboration and updates
