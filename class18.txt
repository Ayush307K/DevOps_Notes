Class 18 - Intorduction to Ci/CD

The Core Problem CI/CD Solves

Before CI/CD, teams did this:
Write code
Manually test
Manually build
Manually deploy
Pray nothing breaks 
Problems:
Slow releases
Human errors
Bugs reach production
No consistency
 CI/CD was created to automate this entire flow.
 
What is CI/CD?

CI/CD has two parts.
CI — Continuous Integration

CI is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository with automated builds and tests.
What happens in CI:
Code pushed to Git
Build runs automatically
Tests run automatically


Two meanings of CD 
Continuous Delivery

Software is always in a deployable state, but deployment needs approval.
Continuous Deployment

Why Do We Need CI/CD?

Benefits:
Faster releases
Automated testing
Reduced human error
Consistent deployments
Rapid feedback

 CI/CD Pipeline 

Typical pipeline:
Code → Build → Test → Scan → Package → Deploy

Tools involved:
Git
GitHub Actions
Docker
Kubernetes

What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates workflows directly from GitHub repositories.

Key idea:
YAML-based workflows
Event-driven

GitHub Actions Core Concepts (VERY IMPORTANT)

 Workflow

Automation pipeline
Defined in YAML
Location:
.github/workflows/

2️Event

Triggers workflow
Examples:
push
pull_request

Job

Set of steps
Runs on a runner
 Runner

Machine that executes jobs
Types:
GitHub-hosted
Self-hosted
Step

Individual task
Implement a Simple CI using GitHub Actions


On every push
Build a Docker image
Sample CI Workflow (EXAM SAFE)

name: CI Pipeline
on:  push:    
branches: [ main ]
jobs:  build:    
runs-on: ubuntu-latest    
steps:    - uses: actions/checkout@v3    
- name: Build Docker image      
run: docker build -t myapp .

What is SAST & SCA? 

SAST — Static Application Security Testing

Analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities without executing it.
Examples:
SonarQube
CodeQL

SAST detects vulnerabilities early in the development phase.
SCA — Software Composition Analysis

Scans third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
Examples:
OWASP Dependency Check
Snyk
SCA identifies risks in open-source dependencies.

Improving CI with SAST & SCA

Updated pipeline:
Code → Build → Test → SAST → SCA → Package
Why important?
Shift-left security
Catch issues early
 Adding Kubernetes as a GitHub Actions Agent (CD)

What is a Self-Hosted Runner?

A self-hosted runner is a machine registered with GitHub Actions to execute workflows.
In your case:
Kubernetes cluster already installed
Register it as runner
Why use K8s as runner?

Direct access to cluster
Faster deployments
Secure CD
Continuous Deployment to Kubernetes (FLOW)

This is a direct exam question.
CD Flow

CI builds Docker image
Image pushed to registry
GitHub Actions job runs on K8s runner
kubectl applies manifests
New version deployed
GitHub → CI → Docker Registry → Kubernetes


- name: Deploy to Kubernetes  run: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
