class 20 - Intro to devsecops and implementing it
GitHub Actions + Docker (Java Maven Project)

1. Setting Up a Git Repository
Clone Repository

Clone the GitHub repository to local machine

Ensure correct project structure:

src/

pom.xml

git clone <repository-url>

Basic Git Commands

git add → stage changes

git commit → save changes

git push → upload to GitHub

Best Practice

Always create the repository on GitHub first

Then clone it locally to avoid conflicts

2. Introduction to GitHub Actions
What is GitHub Actions?

Built-in GitHub tool for CI/CD automation

Executes workflows on GitHub-hosted runners

Workflow Configuration

Workflows are written in YAML

Stored in:

.github/workflows/

Triggers

Common triggers:

push

pull_request

YAML Rules

Indentation is critical

Spaces matter

Prefer copy-paste to avoid syntax errors

Multi-Job Workflows

Multiple jobs can run in parallel

Supported environments:

Ubuntu

Windows

macOS

3. Building and Testing with Maven
Maven Configuration

pom.xml defines:

Dependencies

Plugins

Build settings

CI with Maven

Automate:

Compilation

Testing

Packaging

mvn clean package


Output:

.jar or .war file (based on configuration)

4. Docker Setup and Integration
Docker Configuration

Docker-related files stored with project code

Key file:

Dockerfile

Docker works independently of Java runtime

Docker Hub

Used to store and share Docker images

Images are versioned using tags

Secrets Management

Never hardcode credentials

Use GitHub Secrets for:

Docker Hub username

Docker Hub password or token

Build and Push Docker Images

GitHub Actions can:

Build Docker image

Tag image correctly

Push image to Docker Hub

Testing with Docker

Basic container tests can be automated

Advanced testing depends on application code quality

5. Advanced Topics
Security Scanning

Use CI tools to detect vulnerabilities

Common scans:

SAST (Static Analysis)

DAST (Dynamic Analysis)

Trivy

Used for scanning Docker images

Detects known vulnerabilities

Should fail build if critical issues found

Linting & Static Analysis

Maintain code quality using:

Checkstyle

CodeQL

Helps enforce coding standards and security rules
