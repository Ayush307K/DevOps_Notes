CI/CD with Kubernetes 
Intro

Focus of the class: Deploying applications on Kubernetes

Emphasis on Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)

CI/CD is a core concept in modern DevOps practices

Continuous Integration (CI)

CI = frequent integration of code changes

Developers merge code regularly into a shared repository

Key goals:

Automated builds

Automated testing

Early detection of bugs

Codebase always in a deployable state

Continuous Deployment (CD)

CD extends CI by automating deployment

Code changes are deployed to production automatically

Focus areas:

Infrastructure configuration

Zero or minimal downtime

Faster delivery of features and fixes

Setting Up Kubernetes Environment
Virtual Machine Setup

Minimum requirement: Single-node Kubernetes cluster

Tools used:

VirtualBox

Vagrant

Vagrant:

Uses scripts to automate VM creation

Allows easy setup using copy-paste configurations

Kubernetes Installation

Kubernetes must be installed on the VM

Shortcut approach:

Use a pre-configured AMI with Kubernetes already installed

Saves time and reduces setup complexity

GitHub Actions
What is GitHub Actions?

Tool for automating CI/CD pipelines

Runs workflows directly from GitHub repositories

Supports:

Build

Test

Package

Release

Deploy

Custom (Self-Hosted) Runners
Why Custom Runners?

Used instead of GitHub-hosted runners

Useful for:

Custom environments

Kubernetes access

Cost control

Runner Setup

Recommended OS: Linux

Steps:

Register runner using config.sh

Assign labels for job selection

Apply proper security settings

Runner appears in GitHub repository settings after registration

Project Demonstration & Teamwork

Teams build and present CI/CD-enabled projects

CI/CD implemented using GitHub Actions and related tools

Evaluation:

Team collaboration

Individual understanding and contribution

Each member must clearly explain their role during presentations

Testing and Quality Assurance
Types of Testing

System Integration Testing (SIT)

Performance Testing

Security Testing

Automation in Testing

Testing stages are automated within pipelines

Reduces human error

Ensures consistent and repeatable test execution

Practical Considerations

CI and CD are often kept separate

Separation improves:

Clarity

Control

Stability

Deployment pipelines must be customized based on:

Application requirements
